However, in India, the apple-growing areas do not fall in the temperate zone, but the prevailing temperate climate of the region is due to the Himalayan ranges and high altitudes. The average summer temperature should be around 21-24°C during the active growth period. Apple succeeds best in regions where the trees experience uninterrupted rest in winter and abundant sunshine for good color development. It can be grown at an altitude of 1500-2700m above sea level. Well-distributed rainfall of 1000-1250mm throughout the growing season is most favorable for optimum growth and fruitfulness of apple trees.", "Soil": "Apples grow best on well-drained loam soils with a depth of 45 cm and a pH range of 5.5-6.5.
